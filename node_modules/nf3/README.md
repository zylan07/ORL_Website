<!-- /automd -->

This plugin traces and copies only the `node_modules` that are actually required at runtime for your built output — powered by [@vercel/nft](https://github.com/vercel/nft).

Bundling external dependencies can sometimes fail or cause issues, especially when modules rely on relative paths, native bindings, or dynamic imports.

To solve this, the plugin analyzes your build output, traces its runtime dependencies, and copies a **tree-shaken**, **deduplicated**, and **runtime-only** subset of `node_modules` into `dist/node_modules`.
The result is a minimal, self-contained distribution directory that just works.

Originally extracted from [Nitro](https://nitro.build) and used for optimizing `nf3` package dist itself!

## Usage

### API

```js
import { traceNodeModules } from "nf3";

await traceNodeModules(["./index.mjs"], {
  //   outDir: "dist",
  // chmod: 0o755,
  // writePackageJson: true,
  // traceAlias: {},
  // hooks: {},
  // nft: {}, // https://github.com/vercel/nft#options
});
```

### Rollup/Rolldown/Vite Plugin

```js
import { externals } from "nf3/plugin";

export default {
  plugins: [
    externals({
      // rootDir: ".",
      // conditions: ["node", "import", "default"],
      // include: [/^@my-scope\//],
      // exclude: ["fsevents"],
      // traceInclude: ["some-lib"],
      // trace: {
      //   fullTraceInclude: ["some-lib"],
      // }
    }),
  ],
};
```

### Full Trace Include

By default, only files detected by [`@vercel/nft`](https://github.com/vercel/nft) are included in the output. Some packages may require all their files to be present at runtime (e.g., packages with dynamic requires or asset files).

Use `fullTraceInclude` to specify package names that should have **all** files copied to the output:

```js
rollupNodeFileTrace({
  trace: {
    fullTraceInclude: ["some-package", "@scope/another-package"],
  },
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> Requires Node.js >= 22.0.0 (`fs.promises.glob`).

### Hooks

After the Rollup plugin traces the required files, `traceNodeModules` processes them into an optimized `node_modules` output.

Each phase can be extended through hooks:

```js
rollupNodeFileTrace({
  hooks: {
    traceStart: (files) => {},
    traceResult: (result) => {},
    tracedFiles: (files) => {},
    tracedPackages: (packages) => {},
  },
});
```

### Transforming

Before writing files, you can transform some of them.

**Example:**

```js
import { minify } from "oxc-minify";

rollupNodeFileTrace({
  transform: [
    {
      filter: (id) => /\.[mc]?js$/.test(id),
      handler: (code, id) => minify(id, code, {}).code,
    },
  ],
});
```

## Packages DB

NF3 exports a list of known packages that include native code and require platform-specific builds.

These packages cannot be bundled and should be traced as external dependencies most of the time and often need tracing.

```js
import { NodeNativePackages } from "nf3/db";
```

NF3 exports a list of packages that need full tracing (all files copied instead of only NFT-detected ones), because they use dynamic requires or runtime asset loading that static analysis cannot detect. You can use this with the `traceInclude` plugin option to ensure they are always traced:

```js
import { FullTracePackages } from "nf3/db";

externals({
  traceInclude: [...FullTracePackages],
});
```

NF3 also exports a list of packages that must be externalized rather than bundled, due to bundler compatibility issues with their module format or dynamic imports.

```js
import { NonBundleablePackages } from "nf3/db";
```
