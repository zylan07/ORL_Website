// Note: These declarations exist to avoid type errors when you omit "dom" from
// "lib" in your "tsconfig.json" file. TypeScript confusingly declares the
// global "WebAssembly" type in "lib.dom.d.ts" even though it has nothing to do
// with the browser DOM and is present in many non-browser JavaScript runtimes
// (e.g. node and deno). Declaring it here allows esbuild's API to be used in
// these scenarios.
//
// There's an open issue about getting this problem corrected (although these
// declarations will need to remain even if this is fixed for backward
// compatibility with older TypeScript versions):
